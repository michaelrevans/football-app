# football-app

This repo will contain files for a Django (Python) app, which will consist of two main pages, the first of which being a user-oritentated page, which will at first be able to display football league information (results, table, etc). The second page will be a site admin-orientated page, as it will first of all be a place to enter match results and later maybe also a place to create new leagues, teams for those leagues and maybe even player information.
